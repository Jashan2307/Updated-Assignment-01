        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p><strong>Bhagat Singh (28 September 1907[1] – 23 March 1931) was a charismatic[3] Indian revolutionary[4] who participated in the mistaken murder of a junior British police officer[5] in what was to be retaliation for the death of an Indian nationalist.[6] He later took part in a largely symbolic bombing of the Central Legislative Assembly in Delhi and a hunger strike in jail, which—on the back of sympathetic coverage in Indian-owned newspapers—turned him into a household name in the Punjab region, and after his execution at age 23 into a martyr and folk hero in Northern India.</strong></p>
